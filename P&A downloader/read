Spotify Playlist to Google Drive Discord Bot
A Discord bot that lets you download songs from a Spotify playlist or album by searching and converting them via YouTube, then uploads the MP3 files to your Google Drive.

How It Works
You send the bot a Spotify playlist or album URL in Discord using the command:
!d <spotify_url>

The bot grabs all the songs from the Spotify playlist/album.

For each song, it searches YouTube for the best matching video and downloads the audio as an MP3.

Once all songs are downloaded, the bot uploads them to a new folder in your Google Drive.

The bot then sends you a link to the folder containing your playlist's MP3s.
